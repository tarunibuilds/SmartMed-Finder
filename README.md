# SmartMed Finder 🏥🔍

An intelligent Hospital Information Retrieval System that leverages Information Retrieval (IR) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend relevant doctors and hospitals based on user symptoms and search intent.

The system bridges the gap between user intent and healthcare search results by understanding semantic relevance instead of relying solely on exact keyword matching.
